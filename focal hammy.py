"""
Hamurabi Python 3.13 port. December 2024. M Lauderdale
Much credit to Doug Dyment - the original author of this legendary program
The intent of this python code is to mimic the original as closely as is practical
I have included much of the August, 1968 FOCAL source here (with line nums) for history
Doug's original code has 45 lines and the PDP-8 he ran on had only 4KB user space
Also, FOCAL has only one conditional statement (IF) and it's really clunky
Thus Doug created quite a bit of code smell to work within the limitations
of the tiny memory and FOCALs IF statements... so hat's off to him! The original
FOCAL is https://svn.so-much-stuff.com/svn/trunk/pdp8/src/decus/focal8-5/f0005.fc
